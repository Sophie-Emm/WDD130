    <h2>Gear Purchasing for Starters</h2>
    <p>If youre just getting started, one of the first things youll need is the right type of gear. Many beginners think they have to buy brand-new, top-of-the-line gear, but thats not necessary.
        Small Gear Shops & Used Boards: Local snowboard shops are great places to start. If you're not sure how committed you are yet, buying a used board can be a smart choice. Many people sell high-quality boards that have only been lightly used. Also most resorts rent out their equipment,(boards, helmets, and boots) however this can get expensive. If you are looking for gear like coats pants gloves goggles any brand works and is good! For my coat, I bought it through Burton. The rest of my gear are from miscellaneous brands. Personally I don't think having on brand stuff matters, it's just whatever you're comfortable with while snowboarding.

    </p>
    <p>My Recommendation: If youre serious about getting a high-quality board, I recommend checking out Nidecker. Their boards are on the pricier side, but theyre durable and perform really well.</p>
    <h2>Small Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <p>Start on the Right Slopes: Stick to the bunny hill or beginner trails while you get used to balancing and turning.
        Keep Your Knees Bent: This helps with balance and control.
        Keep your arms in control: This is so that you won't look like an idiot.
        Learn How to Fall: Falling is part of learning. Try to fall on your forearms or back, not your wrists. If you happen to catch yourself on your wrists make sure to keep your hands clenched.
        Take a Lesson: A single lesson from an instructor can make a huge difference in your progress.
        Practice! The more time you spend on the mountain, the better youll get. And make sure you challenge yourself! You will most likely fall countless times the first year or two of learning. But if you stick with it you'll get the hang of it and be cooler than all of your skiing buddies.
