        <h1>My Snowboarding Experience</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my snowboarding website! This site is here to share some of my experiences with snowboarding and hopefully inspire others to give it a try. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone looking for tips on where to go and what gear to buy, this site has something for you. Snowboarding has been a big part of my life, and I want to help others discover the same excitement and adventure that it has brought me. I'm 21 years old and currently attending BYU-Idaho, where I’m majoring in cybersecurity. When I’m not studying, I love hammocking. My favorite color is green, and I’ve recently started longboarding as well. But snowboarding is what I've stuck with for a long time. I started when I was 12, and since then, I’ve spent as much time as possible on the slopes. I’m not in any way a  professional, so this site is mostly for sharing my experiences.</p>
        <h1>Why This Site?</h1>
        <p>I hope to create a realistic site of my experience and give pointers to people who are starting out.
            Visitors will expect my site to answer questions like:
            What kind of gear do I need as a beginner?
            Where are some good places to learn in Idaho?
            What should I expect on my first day snowboarding?
            What are some common mistakes beginners make?
            In addition to reading my experiences, visitors will be able to browse gear recommendations, read resort reviews, and learn tips for making the most of their time on the mountain.</p>
