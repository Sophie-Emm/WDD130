    <h2>Snowboarding Spots in Idaho</h2>
    <p>Even though I haven't been to every mountain in Idaho, I have visited a few that I really enjoyed. Here are my thoughts on each:</p>
    <h3>Pomerelle</h3>
    <p>Located near Declo/Albion, Pomerelle was the first mountain I ever snowboarded on. It's a smaller resort, which makes it perfect for beginners. The runs aren’t too steep, and there are only two lifts plus a bunny hill. It’s a great place to build confidence. The lodge has good food, and night skiing is available, which adds a fun twist to the experience.</p>
    <h3>Grand Targhee</h3>
    <p>Technically located in Alta, Wyoming, this resort is a favorite for snowboarders from Idaho. It has six lifts and plenty of fresh snow. If you're past the beginner stage and want to refine your skills, this is a great place to go. The soft snow makes falls a lot more forgiving, and the variety of runs means you’ll never get bored.</p>
    <h3>Schweitzer</h3>
    <p>Schweitzer, located in Sandpoint, ID, is one of the best mountains I’ve ever been to! Over winter break, I got to ride there after they had just received 10 inches of fresh snow—it was incredible. The terrain is more challenging, with about 10 lifts and 92 total trails. If you're looking for an exciting, high-quality snowboarding experience, I highly recommend it</p>
