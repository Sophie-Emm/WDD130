            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm 21 and attending BYU-Idaho, majoring in cybersecurity. My favorite color is green, and I enjoy spending time outside. I love snowboarding and have recently started learning how to longboard.</p>

            <h2>Gear Purchasing for Starters</h2>
            <p>Small gear shops work perfectly for starters, or even a nice used board can be a great option. If you're serious about this, I recommend Nidecker for high-quality equipment.</p>
            <p>Burton makes great coats and snow pants, but I wouldn't buy their boards—they tend to break easily.</p>

            <h2>The Places I've Been to in Idaho</h2>
            <h3>Pomerelle</h3>
            <p>Located near Declo/Albion, this was my first mountain! It's great for beginners and offers night skiing.</p>

            <h3>Grand Targhee</h3>
            <p>Located in Alta, Wyoming, it’s a great resort for practicing skills with plenty of fresh snow.</p>

            <h3>Schweitzer</h3>
            <p>Located in Sandpoint, ID, this is one of the best mountains I've been to. It has about 10 lifts and 92 trails.</p>
